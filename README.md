# SupervisedLearning-Regression-LinearRegressionWithOneVariable
This repository consists of implementation of linear regression machine learning algorithm with one variable.

Machine Learning concept being worked on:

1. Linear regression machine learning algorithm falls under supervised learning
2. In Linear regression, we will learn a model based to predict a label's value given a set of features that describe the label
3. In the problems that linear regression machine learning algorithm targets, the value of the label is a real value
4. Examples of the problems that linear regression machine learning algorithm attempts to targets are
   a. Predicting the prices of houses, given a set of features about the house, the features would be as area of house, numberof bedrooms of the house, nunber of bathrooms of the house, locality of the house etc.

In this exmple we will perform linear regression to predit the price of the house using one feature in the dataset.

1. Dataset being used: kc_house_data.csv
2. Feature being used: sqft_living
3. Label being predicted: price

Python modules being used: 

1. os: This module provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality.
2. pandas: Pandas provide high-performance data manipulation and analysis tool using its powerful data structures.
3. numpy: NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
4. matplotlib: matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language.
